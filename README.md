## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhrendon/amazon-mcp.git
cd amazon-mcp
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

## Configuration

Edit `.env` with your credentials. You only need to configure the package you plan to use.

### Seller Central (amazon-seller-mcp)

```bash
LWA_CLIENT_ID=amzn1.application-oa2-client.xxxxxxxxxxxx
LWA_CLIENT_SECRET=amzn1.oa2-cs.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SELLER_REFRESH_TOKEN=Atzr|IwEBIxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SELLER_ID=Axxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
MARKETPLACE_ID=ATVPDKIKX0DER
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `LWA_CLIENT_ID` | Your LWA application Client ID |
| `LWA_CLIENT_SECRET` | Your LWA application Client Secret |
| `SELLER_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Refresh Token obtained from SP-API with seller permissions |
| `SELLER_ID` | Your Merchant ID (Seller ID) on Amazon |

| `ADS_PROFILE_ID` | Your advertising profile ID |
| `ADS_API_REGION` | API region: `na`, `eu`, or `fe` |

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Connecting to AI Clients

Each MCP server communicates via **stdio**. Configure your AI client to run the corresponding server.

### Claude Desktop

Edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amazon-seller": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/amazon-mcp/packages/amazon-seller-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LWA_CLIENT_ID": "amzn1.application-oa2-client.xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "LWA_CLIENT_SECRET": "amzn1.oa2-cs.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "SELLER_REFRESH_TOKEN": "Atzr|IwEBIxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "SELLER_ID": "Axxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "MARKETPLACE_ID": "ATVPDKIKX0DER"
      }
    },
    "amazon-ads": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/amazon-mcp/packages/amazon-ads-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LWA_CLIENT_ID": "amzn1.application-oa2-client.xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "LWA_CLIENT_SECRET": "amzn1.oa2-cs.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN": "Atzr|IwEBIxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "ADS_PROFILE_ID": "1234567890",
        "ADS_API_REGION": "na"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor / Windsurf

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` or your editor's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amazon-seller": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/amazon-mcp/packages/amazon-seller-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Environment variables are inherited from `.env` in the project root if running from there.

### Remote MCP (HTTP + Login with Amazon)

Each server can also listen on Streamable HTTP. MCP clients then connect to a URL and sign in with Amazon instead of embedding refresh tokens in client config.

1. Register this redirect URI on your LWA / SP-API application:

   `http://localhost:3000/oauth/amazon/callback` (or your public `https://` URL)

2. Set environment variables:

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=http
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
MCP_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0          # listen on all interfaces when exposing remotely
MCP_HTTP_PORT=3000
LWA_CLIENT_ID=amzn1.application-oa2-client.xxxxxxxxxxxx
LWA_CLIENT_SECRET=amzn1.oa2-cs.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# Draft SP-API apps (default). Set false for published apps:
LWA_CONSENT_DRAFT=true
```

Refresh tokens, `SELLER_ID`, `MARKETPLACE_ID`, and `ADS_PROFILE_ID` are optional in HTTP mode. They are obtained (or discovered) after Login with Amazon. You can still set them as defaults.

3. Start a server:

```bash
# Seller Central
cd packages/amazon-seller-mcp && pnpm start:http

# Ads API (use a different MCP_HTTP_PORT / MCP_SERVER_URL)
cd packages/amazon-ads-mcp && pnpm start:http
```

4. Point the MCP client at the `/mcp` URL. Cursor example (`.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amazon-seller": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The client discovers OAuth metadata, opens Login with Amazon (Ads) or Seller Central consent (Seller), and then calls the MCP server with a bearer token. Amazon API calls use that user's LWA tokens.

Use HTTPS and a public `MCP_SERVER_URL` in production. HTTP is allowed for local development. OAuth sessions are stored in memory, so a process restart requires signing in again.

### Development with tsx

For development without building:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amazon-seller": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/amazon-mcp/packages/amazon-seller-mcp/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

```

CI/CD with GitHub Actions runs on `v*` tag push: tests, build, npm publish, and GitHub Release creation.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Error

```
Authentication failed. Please check your LWA credentials.
```

1. Verify `LWA_CLIENT_ID` and `LWA_CLIENT_SECRET` are correct
2. Confirm the refresh token has not expired (regenerate if needed)
3. For Seller Central: token must have SP-API scopes
4. For Ads API: token must have `advertising::campaign_management` scope

### Rate Limiting

```
Rate limited by Amazon API. Please try again later.
```

The client automatically retries with exponential backoff. If persistent, reduce call frequency.

### Brand Registry Required

```
Sponsored Brands API requires Brand Registry.
```

Sponsored Brands and some Brand Analytics tools require active Brand Registry in Seller Central.

### Server Won't Start

1. Verify environment variables are set
2. Run `pnpm build` before using `node dist/index.js`
3. In development use `pnpm dev` (tsx) to skip building
4. Check stderr output: the server validates credentials against Amazon before accepting connections
